# 3D-Knapsack-Problem-With-Pentominos
This project seeks to explore the famed knapsack problem in a 3D context using "parcels" shaped as pentominoes (shapes only one size unit larger than those of the famed tetrominoes from tetris) holding different values to maximise value while filling a theoretical cargo space with various algorithms.
